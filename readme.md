## Introduction

Welcome to the BMI Add-on! This is a plug-in designed to help determine Body Mass Index (BMI), an international measure used to assess a person’s body fat level. With this add-on, you can easily calculate your BMI by entering your height and weight.

In addition to BMI calculation, this new version offers extra features such as ideal BMI calculation based on height and a detailed classification according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, providing personalized health recommendations.

Note: For a proper interpretation of BMI, it's important to consider other factors such as body composition, fat distribution, age, sex, and overall health. It is always advisable to consult a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or nutritionist, for a more accurate assessment and appropriate health and weight guidance.

## Installation

Here are the step-by-step instructions to install the BMI Add-on in NVDA:

1. Download the Add-on installation file from the Add-ons Store or from the official [BMI page](https://github.com/EdilbertoFonseca/BMI).
   Note: If the add-on is downloaded from the store, installation will occur automatically. Otherwise, follow the instructions below.
2. Press Enter on the downloaded add-on file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
4. Restart NVDA.
5. Press `NVDA+N` to open the "Tools" menu and check if the BMI Add-on is listed among the tools.

You're now ready to use the BMI Add-on and calculate your Body Mass Index directly in NVDA.

* Your detailed classification according to WHO parameters (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity grade I, II, or III).
* The estimated value of your ideal BMI based on your height.
* A guidance message emphasizing the importance of additional factors in health assessment.

At the end of the dialog, the cursor will be positioned on the OK button. Pressing Enter will reposition the cursor to the height field.
