## Introduction

Welcome to the BMI Add-on! This is a plug-in designed to help determine the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is an international measurement used to assess a person's body fat level. With this Addon you can easily calculate your BMI by providing your height and weight. In addition, we also offer a ranking of the results, so that you can better understand your situation and take the necessary steps to achieve and maintain good health. Note: Remember to always consult a doctor or nutritionist before making any decisions.
