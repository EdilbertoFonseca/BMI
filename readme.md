## Introduction

Welcome to the BMI Add-on! This is a plug-in designed to help determine the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is an international measurement used to assess a person's body fat level. With this Addon you can easily calculate your BMI by providing your height and weight.

 Note: For a proper interpretation of BMI, it is recommended to consider other factors such as body composition, fat distribution, age, gender and general health of the person. It is always recommended to consult a health professional, such as a doctor or nutritionist, for a more accurate assessment and to obtain proper guidance on health and weight.
